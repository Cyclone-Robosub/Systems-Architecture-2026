# Systems-Architecture-2026
The new and improved codebase for 2026 (and hopefully beyond)!

This will contain the ROS nodes, topics, etc. developed by the Systems Architecture subteam of UC Davis Cyclone Robosub. It will also contain C code auto-generated by Matlab to be used in the robot control system.

## How to use launch files
Launch files are a alternative to bash script for runnign ROS nodes
1. Run `colcon build` in the workspace
2. Run `source install/setup.bash`
3. Run `ros2 launch $pkg_name $launch_file_name` wher the `pkg_name` is the name of the package and `launch_file_name` is the name fo the launch file.
4. For example, the command for the pwm_ci package would be `ros2 launch pwm_cli cli_launch.py` (presuming you have done step 1 and 2)
